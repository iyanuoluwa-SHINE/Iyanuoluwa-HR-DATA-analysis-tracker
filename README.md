### Project Overview

The Incubator Hub HR Data Analysis Tracker is a Power BI project designed to analyze and track employee attrition data.
This dashboard provides HR teams with insights into employee demographics, attrition counts by gender, department, and educational field, along with other metrics to guide strategic HR decisions.


### Data Sources

The analysis utilizes the HR Employee Dataset, which contains comprehensive employee records, including:

**I.Employee Demographics:** Age, gender, and educational field .

**II.Employment Details:** Information on employee  departments.

**III.Attrition Indicators:** Attrition status for each employee, providing data on whether they have left the organization.


### Tools and Methodology

**Power BI:** Power BI is used to create interactive visualizations and a dynamic dashboard, enabling a deep dive into attrition metrics. Power BI’s functionality allows HR users to filter and segment data by key attributes, making it easy to identify trends and patterns.

**Data Processing:** Basic data cleaning and formatting were done within Power BI to ensure consistency in metrics such as age, gender, and attrition counts.


###  Key Metrics and Questions Addressed in the Analysis

**Total Number of Current Employees:** The total count of active employees, providing a snapshot of the current workforce size.

**Total Number of Employees:** A complete count of all employees in the dataset, establishing a baseline for analysis.

**Average Employee Age:** Calculates the average age of employees, offering insights into the workforce’s age demographics.

**Total Number of Attritions:** The count of all employees who have left the organization, allowing HR to gauge turnover volume.

**Attrition Rate:** Measures the percentage of employees who have left compared to the total workforce, indicating the overall attrition level.

**Sum of Attrition Count by Gender:** Aggregates attrition counts by gender, helping to identify any gender-related patterns in turnover.

**Sum of Attrition Count by Department:** Breaks down attrition counts by department, highlighting high-attrition areas that may need additional focus.

**Sum of Attrition Count by Educational Field:** Analyzes attrition counts by educational background, exploring any correlation between educational fields and turnover.


## Data Analysis and Visualization (Using Power BI)
### The dashboard visualizes these key metrics through various interactive charts and graphs:

**Pie Chart for Attrition by Gender:** Shows the proportion of male and female attrition, allowing HR to assess any gender-based trends.

**Donut Chart for Attrition by Department:** Illustrates the attrition distribution across departments, revealing high-turnover departments.

**Bar Chart for Attrition by Educational Field:** Displays attrition counts by educational field, providing insight into any education-based attrition patterns.
